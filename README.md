# Codebreaking Game
This is a computer codebreaking game similar to the paper and pencil game [bulls and cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) or [pigs and bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) in that it uses digits for the code, the difference being that in the paper and pencil game digits must be all different, while in the computer version repetitions are permitted. In this aspect this game is more similar to the board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), which uses colours for the code and repetitions are permitted.

How it works:

A four digit code is generated by the computer; the player has ten tries to guess the code and after ten incorrect guesses the game is over. After each try feedback is given in the form of a black dot for each correct digit in the right place, a white dot for each correct digit in the wrong place and an x for each incorrect digit.

This is a trial and error game which seeks to develop critical thinking and logical deduction. Players learn how to analyze clues, form hypotheses and recognize patterns.
